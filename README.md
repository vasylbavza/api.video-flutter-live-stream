# apivideolivestream

A new flutter plugin project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


### Manages application lifecycle

On the application side, you must manage application lifecycle:
```dart
  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    if (state == AppLifecycleState.inactive) {
      _controller.stop();
    } else if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed) {
      _controller.startPreview();
    }
  }
```
